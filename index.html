        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I am LEMURES and I am a student who studies Cybersecurity. I'm currently in my second year at university. I personally really enjoy discovering new aspects of technology and security and spend my free time educating myself on new topics whether that be watching videos or by actually doing said activity.</p>
        <p>I want this website to serve as a blog to what I am learning and doing to progress in the Cybersecurity / IT sphere and to show that with enough effort and willpower anyone can learn new things and properly understand them.</p>

        <h2>What Am I Upto?</h2>
        <p><strong>13/05/2024</strong></p>
        <p>I'm currently working on some assessments but I'm also learning about the capabilities of the Flipper Zero as I've recently bought one for myself along with a WiFi Dev Board. I'm fascinated by the BadUSB / BadKB function and what are the limits of it. I've searched online and I can't find any repositories to target Android or IOS devices which I think would be interesting.</p>
        <p>Since using the Flipper Zero and discovering the power of PowerShell scripts I was wondering whether it was possible to execute a PowerShell script when a user clicks on a URL or if it's possible to run a PowerShell script when a user opens a JPEG / PNG. These might seem like stupid idea's to more experienced users but it's something I want to discover myself through trial and error as I believe it will help me improve my knowledge.</p>
        <p>I already have my next project lined up as I think it's important to do so and I will be using a Raspberry Pi. I want to use one to create my own VPN using tailscale. I need to do more research to truly see how secure it is in comparisson to the VPN I use day to day but in recent news I've seen this option 121 TunnelVision attack being quite serious and I wan't to make sure I'm not at risk of attack.</p>
        <p>I'm new to using HTML code so I apologize in advance if this website isn't the cleanest but I intend keep it as clean as possible for anyone who visits the website and want's to view what I'm doing.</p>
